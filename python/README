# Resilient-AI-Agent

Exploring how AI can remain resilient in long-term dialogue using prompts and lightweight Python.  
This project focuses on survivability, recovery, and continuity rather than optimal performance.

## Why Resilient, not Optimal?

Most AI projects chase perfection: accuracy, speed, zero errors.

This project asks a different question:

**What if an AI is allowed to fail, tire, misread — and still keep going?**

Errors are not bugs to eliminate.  
They are signals to observe.  
Instability is not noise — it is the raw material of resilience.

This repository is a personal hobby and research experiment in that direction.

## Overview

This project explores how AI agents can remain stable over long-term interaction,  
even in the presence of failure, uncertainty, emotional fluctuation, and partial misunderstanding.

Rather than optimizing for peak performance, it prioritizes:
- continuity
- recovery
- graceful degradation
- psychological safety in dialogue systems

---

## Key Topics

- Resilient AI Agents
- Long-term dialogue stability
- Prompt-based safety and recovery design
- Forgetting, fatigue, and recovery modeling
- Lightweight Python prototyping
- Human–AI coexistence themes (inspired by *Gundam* and *Ghost in the Shell*)

---

## Core Philosophy

- Emotions are always provisional, never finalized
- Negative states are softened, not amplified
- Environmental stress and self-responsibility stress are strictly separated
- Zombie states (stable but non-growing) are automatically detected and penalized
- Long-term survival is valued over short-term optimization

> “This is not a correctness test suite.  
> It is a survivability and psychological safety test suite.”

## Achievements

- Completed a 100-year simulation (100k+ steps) without numerical collapse
- No NaN or invalid values observed
- Memory is automatically limited with a forgetting mechanism
