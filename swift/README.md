# Resilient AI Agent – Swift Version

This directory contains the **Swift implementation** of the Resilient AI Agent.

This version is a **manual translation and adaptation** of the original Python design.
It focuses on clarity, resilience, and ease of understanding rather than performance or completeness.

---

## Purpose

The goal of the Swift version is to:

- Explore how the Resilient AI Agent design can be expressed in Swift
- Provide a readable reference for learning and experimentation
- Serve as a foundation for future expansion (iOS, macOS, or CLI tools)

This is **not** intended to be a production-ready AI system.

---

## Design Philosophy

- Explicit state handling over hidden magic
- Simple structures over complex abstractions
- Readability prioritized for future maintainers (including future me)
