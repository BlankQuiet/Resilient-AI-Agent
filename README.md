# Resilient AI Agent

Exploring how AI can remain resilient in long-term dialogue using prompts and lightweight Python.

This project focuses not on performance optimization,  
but on how an AI can continue to function through failure, ambiguity, and emotional fluctuation.

## Why Resilient, not Optimal?

Most AI projects chase perfection: accuracy, speed, zero errors.

This one does something different.

It asks:

**What if an AI is allowed to fail, tire, misread — and still keep going?**

Errors are not bugs to eliminate.  
They are data to observe.  
Instability is not noise — it is the raw material of resilience.

This repository is a personal, ongoing experiment  
in designing AI behavior that prioritizes survival and continuity over optimization.

## What this repository contains

- Prompt-based design for long-term dialogue stability  
- Lightweight Python experiments supporting prompt behavior  
- Dialogue logs, failure cases, and recovery patterns  
- Notes on emotional fluctuation, forgetting, and fatigue in AI interaction

This is not a finished theory or framework.  
It is a record of exploration — and sometimes, near-breakdown — kept intentionally visible.
