# Resilient-AI-Agent

**English:** Exploring how AI can remain resilient in long-term dialogue using prompts and lightweight Python.  
**日本語:** プロンプトと軽量Pythonを使い、AIが長期対話で壊れずに振る舞い続ける仕組みを探究

## Why Resilient, not Optimal?

Most AI projects chase perfection: accuracy, speed, zero errors.

This one asks something different:

**What if the AI is allowed to fail, tire, misread — and still keep going?**

Errors are not bugs to eliminate.  
They are data to observe and learn from.  
Instability is not noise — it is the raw material of true resilience.

This repository is a personal hobby experiment in that direction.

## Overview
This project explores how AI agents can remain stable over long-term interaction, even in the presence of failure, uncertainty, and emotional fluctuation.

Rather than aiming for perfect performance, it focuses on continuity, recovery, and resilience in dialogue-based AI systems.

## Key Topics / 関心テーマ
- Grok Companion (AI as a long-term, resilient companion)
- AI & Psychology (Modeling human-like emotional resilience and recovery)
- Breakdown Prevention in Long-term Dialogues (Handling recovery, forgetting, fatigue)
- Prompt-Level Safety Guards (Design philosophy expressed through prompts alone)
- Iterative Prototyping from Smartphone/PC Copy-Paste (Start simple, improve through repetition)
- Gundam (Inspired by themes of resilience, human-machine coexistence, and long-term survival)
- Ghost in the Shell (Inspired by human-AI integration, identity, consciousness, and persistent existence in digital age)

## Core Philosophy
- Emotions remain provisional — never finalized.
- Negative emotions are gently flowed (intensity always ≥ 0).
- Reflection on "black history" ends with embarrassment — recovery comes at a cost.
- Strict separation of environmental stress and self-responsibility stress.
- Automatically detects and penalizes zombie states (high resilience but low growth).
- Long-term survival and gentle recovery are prioritized over peak performance.

## Key Achievements
- Survived 100-year simulation (109,575 steps) under simultaneous collapse patterns.
- Zero numerical breakdown (no NaN, no negative values).
- Memory is automatically limited to 100 entries with forgetting mechanism.
